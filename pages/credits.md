This site provides a draft reconstruction of a manuscript broken by Otto Ege in the 1940s. Many thanks to the IIIF-enabled sites from which the images for the reconstruction are drawn. Also many thanks to Barbara Shailor for providing the vision that has led to multiple digital reconstructions of Ege's manuscripts, to Lisa Fagin Davis for driving North American fragmentology forward in so many ways, and to Scott Gwara for producing "the book" on Otto Ege's dispersed leaves.

Many thanks to Alex Gill for introducing me (and many others) to the joys of minimal computing frameworks like Wax, and to Marii Nyr√∂p for developing such a wonderfully flexible, low-overhead system!
