"Celebrating the Liturgy's Books" was originally produced by Susan Boynton in collaboration with CCNMTL (now CTL) at Columbia University. This forward migration and edition of the project was built by John Glasenapp and [Alex Gil](http://elotroalex.com). The project is sponsored by [Digital Scholarship at Columbia University Libraries](https://library.columbia.edu/services/digital-scholarship.html).

The project was built using [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) by [Marii Nyr√∂p](http://marii.info/).
