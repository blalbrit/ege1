Easter is the most important event in the Christian year, and the calculation of its date was paramount. The Computus served as a guide for this purpose.

Computus in its simplest definition is the art of ascertaining time by the course of the sun and the moon. This art could be and was a theoretical science, such as that explored by Johannes of Sacrobosco in his *De sphera* -a science based on arithmetical calculations and astronomical measurements derived from use of the astrolabe or, increasingly by the end of the 13th century, the solar quadrant. Computus is understood mainly, however, as the practical application of these calculations. To reckon time in the broadest sense and to determine the date of Easter became one and the same effort. And for most people, understanding the problem of correct alignment of solar, lunar, yearly and weekly cycles to arrive at the date of Easter was simply reduced to a question of "when?" rather than "why?". The result was a profusion of calculation formulae, charts and memory devices.

Accompanying these handy mechanisms for determining the date of Easter were many other bits of calendrical information that faith, prejudice, and experience leveled to the same degree of acceptance and necessity: the lucky and the unlucky days for travel or for eating goose; the prognostications of rain or wind; the times for bloodletting; the signs of the zodiac; the phases of the moon; the number of hours of sunshine in a given day; the feasts of the saints; the Sundays in a perpetual calendar.

***A Complete Calendar*** 

The calendar reproduced here in its entirety is in a book devoted to computistical materials copied in England in the middle years of the 15th century; the calendar itself was probably copied ca. 1417. The codex contains the present calendar, charts of the eclipses of the sun and of the moon, Chaucer's Treatise on the Astrolabe, and a brief medicinal tract on humors of the body.

This calendar contains a large number of computistical columns, given the nature of its text; most liturgical calendars only have the columns numbered 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 below:

1. Beginning of dawn
2. Midnight
3. First Metonic cycle of conjunctions for the years 1387-1405 (left blank)
4. Second Metonic cycle of conjunctions for the years 1406-1424
5. Sunrise
6. Altitude of the sun at noon
7. Golden Numbers
8. Dominical Letters
9. Numbering of the days per month
10. Numbering of the days according to the calends, nones and ides
11. Names of the calends, nones and ides
12. Saints' feasts
13. Planetary hours
14. Third Metonic cycle of conjunctions for the years 1425-1443
15. Fourth Metonic cycle of conjunctions for the years 1444-1462
16. Midday
17. Beginning of dusk
